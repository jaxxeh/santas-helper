## Zero-to-Mastery [Coding Challenge #4](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/learn/v4/announcements?ids=1459320)

1. clone the repository and cd to it
2. run `node main.js`

Feel free to reuse `main.js` and `time-tester.js` to test your own solutions.

Note that the data is read once (synchronously) from the `input.txt` file and then passed on to the solutions to be tested. The output is formatted and displayed from within the test helper as well. Neither the file read nor the console output are included in the execution time measured for any solution. Thus the time being measured is purely computational, from the point where your solution is passed the input data to the point where it returns a value.
